# Data-competition-Team4

It's about a team project offered by CEC Club & BinatnaData as a competition to gain more skills and add new competencies to our career in the Data field.
We worked with Airplane Crashes and Fatalities Since 1908 data file.
As team we tried our best to clean it and extract the new data as Data_cleaned file.
And we converted all the data to graphs in our dashboard analysis by the PowerBI app.
