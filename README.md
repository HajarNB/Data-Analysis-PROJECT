# Data competition project Team

Our team participated in a project offered by CEC Club & BinatnaData. 
It was a competition aimed at enhancing our skills and competencies in the field of Data.
We chose to work on the Airplane Crashes and Fatalities Since the 1908 data file. Together, we cleaned and extracted new data from it.
Then, we converted all the data into graphs using the PowerBI app, which we integrated into our dashboard analysis.
