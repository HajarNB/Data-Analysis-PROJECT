# Data-competition-Team4

It's about a team project offered by CEC Club & BinatnaData as a competition to gain more skills and add new competencies to our career in the Data field.
We worked with Airplane Crashes and Fatalities Since the 1908 data file.
As a team, we tried our best to clean it and extract the new data as a Data_cleaned file.
We converted all the data to graphs in our dashboard analysis by the PowerBI app.
